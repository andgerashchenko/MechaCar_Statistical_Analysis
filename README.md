## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- According to our results of statistical summary of multiple linear regression, we can assume that vehicle length, ground clearance and intercept provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values and have significant impact on the mpg, because their Pr(>|t|) values are close to zero. 
- Slope or p-value of the multiple linear model is 5.35e-11, which is not equal to zero. Therefore we can reject null hypothesis and consider that there is a relationship between independent and dependent values.
- Also adjusted R-squared value is 0.68, which indicates on high correlation level and the model can be considered capable to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
